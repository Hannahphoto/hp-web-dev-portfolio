                        been a photo tech managing the photo & video facility at the Community College of Philadelphia.
                        I keep the facility up to date with the propper technology and software as well as repair or trouble
                        shoot any malfunctions. Opportunities in photography are sparce and I do not like being bored.
                        have learned the skills of a Web Developer and look foward to the challenges this career entails..</p>
